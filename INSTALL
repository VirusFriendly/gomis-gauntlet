INSTALLING MISSIONS

In the Artemis install folder, there's a subfolder called 'Dat'.  Inside that is another folder called 'Missions'.
 
Inside the Missions folder, each mission needs to have its own unique folder. Each mission folder name must start with 'MISS_'. Inside a mission folder must be 1 XML file.  It must share the same exact name as the folder it's inside, except for the .xml suffix.  This file will contain all the commands that make the mission happen.  There may be other files in the same folder.  As a general rule, any sound, video, or image files that the mission uses must be in the same folder as the XML file that references it.

STARTING MISSIONS
 
When the Artemis game starts up, choose "Start Server".  At that point, the game will look inside the Missions subfolder and make a list of every folder that starts with 'MISS_'.  On the Server control screen you can select one of those missions.  If you do, you can still set the game difficulty.  The diff setting won't control the amount and type of enemies (the mission will do that), but it will still control the enemy beam damage and the efficiency of the Artemis' systems.
